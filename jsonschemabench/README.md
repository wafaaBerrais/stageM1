Reliably generating structured outputs is a key capability for modern LLM applications. Despite its growing adoption, a systematic evaluation of structured output generation is still lacking. With JSON Schema emerging as the standard format for structured data, we introduce JSONSchemaBench a benchmark of around 10,000 real-world JSON schemas that capture a wide range of constraints and complexities.
JSONSchemaBench helps to measure **efficiency** and **coverage** of a given structured output engine.

## 🔔 News

 – *JSONSchemaBench* is now supported in the [**EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness**](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/lm_eval/tasks/jsonschema_bench/README.md)!  
While originally designed to benchmark the performance of **constrained decoding engines**, JSONSchemaBench can also be used to assess an LLM's **native ability to generate structured outputs** that conform to a given JSON schema — without any constrained decoding. We also have a leaderboard to track the 📊 [Benchmark results for several popular models](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gloUwsKiiOgrBmxbNluh-2_-vV_6RgaPji6KAD52pv0/edit?usp=sharing)


## JsonSchemaBench

Visit [epfl-dlab/jsonschemabench](https://github.com/epfl-dlab/jsonschemabench) for the codebase of JSONSchemaBench.

## MaskBench

On top of JSONSchemaBench's view on real world JSON schema, we also develop a purely performance-oriented benchmark [MaskBench](./maskbench) targeting mask computation times. This benchmark emphasizes results relevant to server-side deployments of constrained decoding.

## Dataset Details

JSONSchemaBench is built from a collection of real-world JSON schemas drawn from diverse sources, including GitHub, Kubernetes configurations, and API specifications. The benchmark consists of schemas categorized into datasets based on complexity and domain. We start from collections from [json-schema-corpus](https://github.com/sdbs-uni-p/json-schema-corpus) and did heavy curation to ensure the schemas are standard-compliant and satisfiable. We also added schemas from other sources to increase the diversity of the benchmark, such as [GlaiveAI function call schemas](https://huggingface.co/datasets/glaiveai/glaive-function-calling-v2) and [kubernetes schemas](https://github.com/instrumenta/kubernetes-json-schema).
We then categorized the schemas into datasets based on complexity and domain. The datasets are as follows:

<div align="center">

| Dataset         | Category            | Count |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ----- |
| GlaiveAI-2K     | Function Call       | 1707  |
| Github-Trivial  | Misc                | 444   |
| Github-Easy     | Misc                | 1943  |
| Snowplow        | Operational API     | 403   |
| Github-Medium   | Misc                | 1976  |
| Kubernetes      | Kubernetes API      | 1064  |
| Washington Post | Resource Access API | 125   |
| Github-Hard     | Misc                | 1240  |
| JSONSchemaStore | Misc                | 492   |
| Github-Ultra    | Misc                | 164   |
| **Total**       |                     | 9558

### 📥 Accessing the Dataset on Hugging Face
JSONSchemaBench is now available on the Hugging Face Hub. You can load it directly using the `datasets` library:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("epfl-dlab/JSONSchemaBench")
print(dataset)  
```
Each dataset split contains:
- `"json_schema"`: The schema definition.
- `"unique_id"`: A unique identifier for the schema.
